A list of my completed HackTheBox boxes. I will also have my writeups/walkthroughs for retired ones. Ordered by difficulty first, then name.
<br />

| Box Name  | Difficulty | Platform | Date Rooted | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Bounty Hunter | Easy | Linux | 8/30/21 | A little difficult, but very fun |
| Cap | Easy | Linux | 8/03/21 | Very easy and good introductory box |
| Horizontall | Easy | Linux | 9/6/21 | A lot harder than other easy boxes |
| Knife | Easy | Linux | 8/28/21 | Kinda weird, didn't like it too much |
| <a href="https://susmdt.github.io/Nigerald/HTB/Love"> Love </a>  | Easy | Windows | 8/19/21 | Pretty fun and simple |
| Forge | Medium | Linux | 9/11/2021 | User was hard but super fun, root was too easy |
