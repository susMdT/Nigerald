Hello, my name is Dylan Tran and this is my blog. I'm a freshman at Cal Poly Pomona majoring in Computer Science. I like pentesting and am studying cybersecurity related stuff. I'm involved with the SWIFT Club on campus (Students with an Interest in the Future of Technology). I'm also involved as a participant for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition teams for Cal Poly Pomona. I started my journey in cybersecurity around the beginning of July in 2021.
